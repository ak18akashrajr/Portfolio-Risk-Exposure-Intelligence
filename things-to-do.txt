1. analyze order history and fetch holdings at portfolio
(needs to be done systematically)
2. make a dedicated transaction page, where the user could see the entire order history -> also Add feature to filter to view only 
3. With that proper order_history current holdings needs to be displayed automatically.
4. Also DB la id laan cache ah irukanum


Now currently the the data can be uploaded manually,
 I wanted you to analyze the '.xlsx' file where the order_history 
 would be passed to you. You need to pass those data to the db.
  Hope you get that.
